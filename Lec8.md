## 🏢 Corporate-Level Strategy

Corporate-level strategy defines the **overall direction** of an organization and how it intends to achieve **synergy** across various business units. It addresses the key question:  
> *"What business or businesses should we be in?"*

## 🗂️ Portfolio Strategy

**Definition:**  
Portfolio strategy refers to:
> A type of corporate-level strategy that focuses on the **organization’s mix of strategic business units (SBUs)** and **product lines**, arranged in a way that creates **synergy** and provides a **competitive advantage**.

### 🔹 Strategic Business Units (SBUs):
SBUs are **distinct divisions** within a larger organization. Each SBU:
- Has its **own mission**
- Offers a **specific product line**
- Faces **different competitors**
- Operates in a **unique market**

> 🧠 *Example: Procter & Gamble operates SBUs like Oral Care (e.g., Oral-B), Laundry (e.g., Tide), and Baby Care (e.g., Pampers), each targeting different markets and consumers.*

## 📊 The BCG Matrix (Boston Consulting Group Matrix)

The BCG Matrix is a key portfolio analysis tool used to evaluate SBUs along two dimensions:

1. **Market Share** — Does the SBU have a **larger or smaller** share compared to competitors?
2. **Market Growth** — Is the industry experiencing **rapid or slow** growth?

### 🧭 The Four Quadrants:

| Quadrant       | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⭐ **Stars**     | High market growth + High market share. Require investment to maintain lead |
| 🐄 **Cash Cows** | Low market growth + High market share. Generate steady cash flow             |
| ❓ **Question Marks** | High market growth + Low market share. Need decisions on investment or divestment |
| 🐶 **Dogs**      | Low market growth + Low market share. Often candidates for divestment        |

> 🧪 *Example: Apple’s iPhone may be a Star; iPod (now discontinued) would have become a Dog.*

## 🔄 Diversification Strategy

**Definition:**  
A corporate strategy that involves **moving into new lines of business**, which may be related or unrelated to the company’s existing operations.

### 🔸 Related Diversification
Entering a business that is **linked** in some way (technology, markets, supply chain).

> 🐾 *Example: Nestlé moving from food and beverages into the pet food industry (Purina) — both involve FMCG expertise.*

### 🔹 Unrelated Diversification
Entering a **completely different industry** with no significant connection.

> 🛞 *Example: Servis Shoes also manufacturing Servis Tyres — footwear and automotive industries are unrelated.*

### Benefits of Diversification:
- Risk spreading across industries
- Leverage existing resources
- Opportunities for growth

> 🧠 *Example: Tata Group has diversified into automobiles (Tata Motors), IT (TCS), steel (Tata Steel), and hotels (Taj Hotels).*
