# Organizational Structure

## 1. Departmentalization

**Departmentalization** is the basis on which individuals are grouped into departments and departments into total organizations[cite: 1]. It defines how an organization segments its activities and allocates responsibilities.

## 2. Basic Forms of Organizational Design

Organizations use different approaches to departmentalization, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

### 2.1. Vertical Functional Approach

Also known as the **U-form**, in this approach, positions are grouped into departments based on similar skills, resources, and expertise use[cite: 2, 3].

**Characteristics:**
* A hierarchical structure where departments are organized by specialized functions like Human Resources, Manufacturing, and Accounting[cite: 3].
* All employees performing a specific function are grouped together under one functional head.

**Advantages:**
* Efficient use of resources and economies of scale[cite: 3].
* In-depth skill specialization and development within departments[cite: 3].
* Clear career progression paths within functional departments[cite: 3].
* Strong top manager direction and control[cite: 3].
* Excellent coordination within functions[cite: 3].
* High-quality technical problem solving[cite: 3].

**Disadvantages:**
* Poor communication across different functional departments[cite: 3].
* Slow response to external changes, leading to lagging innovation[cite: 3].
* Decisions are concentrated at the top of the hierarchy, causing delays[cite: 3].
* Difficulty in pinpointing responsibility for problems[cite: 3].
* Limited view of organizational goals by employees, as they often focus only on their functional area[cite: 3].
* Limited general management training for employees[cite: 3].

*Example:* A small manufacturing company might be organized functionally, with separate departments for production, sales, marketing, and finance. Each department handles all aspects of its function for all products the company makes.

### 2.2. Divisional Approach

In a divisional approach, departments are grouped based on similar organizational outputs, which could be products, services, customer groups, or geographic regions[cite: 4].

**Characteristics:**
* Each division operates somewhat like a separate business unit, often having its own functional departments (e.g., Human Resources, Manufacturing, Accounting within each division)[cite: 4].
* Common types include product divisions (e.g., Product Division 1, Product Division 2) or geographic-based divisions[cite: 4, 5].
    * **Geographic-based Division:** For a global organization, divisions might be based on regions such as Australia and New Zealand Division, Americas Division, European Division, and Asian Division, all reporting to a Chief Executive Officer with corporate staff oversight[cite: 5].

**Advantages:**
* Fast response and flexibility, especially in an unstable environment[cite: 5].
* Fosters a strong concern for customers' needs within each division[cite: 5].
* Excellent coordination across functional departments within the division[cite: 5].
* Easy to pinpoint responsibility for product or division-specific problems[cite: 5].
* Emphasis on overall product and division goals[cite: 5].
* Provides opportunities for the development of general management skills as managers oversee a broader range of functions within their division[cite: 5].

**Disadvantages:**
* Duplication of resources across different divisions, potentially leading to inefficiencies[cite: 5].
* Less technical depth and specialization within divisions compared to a functional structure[cite: 5].
* Poor coordination across different divisions[cite: 5].
* Less top management control over day-to-day divisional operations[cite: 5].
* Potential for competition among divisions for corporate resources[cite: 5].

*Example:* General Motors uses a divisional structure, with separate divisions for Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, and Buick. Each division has its own design, engineering, and marketing teams, allowing them to focus on specific market segments.

### 2.3. Matrix Approach

The matrix approach is a mixture of both functional and divisional approaches[cite: 6]. It is a structure that utilizes functional and divisional chains of command simultaneously in the same part of the organization[cite: 6].

**Characteristics:**
* Employees report to two managers: a functional manager (vertical chain of command for functions like Finance, Engineering, Manufacturing, Marketing) and a product/project manager (horizontal chain of command for product divisions like Product Manager A, B, C)[cite: 6]. This creates a "two-boss" employee scenario[cite: 6].
* A **Global Matrix** structure extends this concept internationally, with divisions for different geographic regions (e.g., Germany, Latin America) intersecting with worldwide product lines (e.g., worldwide plastic products, glass fibres, insulation products)[cite: 7].

**Advantages:**
* More efficient use of resources than a single hierarchy[cite: 7].
* Increased flexibility and adaptability to a changing environment[cite: 7].
* Develops both general and specialist management skills[cite: 7].
* Fosters interdisciplinary cooperation, with expertise available to all divisions[cite: 7].
* Enlarged tasks for employees due to exposure to multiple projects/functions[cite: 7].

**Disadvantages:**
* Can lead to frustration and confusion from the dual chain of command[cite: 7].
* High potential for conflict between the two sides of the matrix (functional vs. project goals)[cite: 7].
* Requires many meetings and can involve more discussion than action[cite: 7].
* Requires significant human relations training for managers and employees[cite: 7].
* Potential for power dominance by one side of the matrix over the other[cite: 7].

*Example:* Many large consulting firms or aerospace companies use a matrix structure. For instance, an engineer might report to both the head of the engineering department and the project manager for a specific aircraft development program.

### 2.4. Team-Based Approach

This approach focuses on organizing work around teams rather than traditional departments.

**Types of Teams:**
* **Cross-functional team:** A group of employees assigned to a functional department that meets to resolve mutual problems[cite: 8]. These teams bring together individuals from different functional areas to address specific issues.
* **Permanent teams:** A group of participants from several functions who are permanently assigned to solve ongoing problems of common interest[cite: 9]. These teams are a more enduring feature of the organizational structure.

**Advantages:**
* Retains some advantages of a functional structure (e.g., specialized expertise).
* Reduced barriers among departments and increased compromise[cite: 9].
* Less response time and quicker decisions due to direct collaboration[cite: 9].
* Better morale and enthusiasm from employee involvement[cite: 9].
* Reduced administrative overheads[cite: 9].

**Disadvantages:**
* Can lead to dual loyalties and conflicts for employees belonging to both a functional department and a team[cite: 9].
* Time and resources can be extensively spent on meetings[cite: 9].
* Potential for unplanned decentralization, where teams might operate too independently without sufficient coordination[cite: 9].

*Example:* A software development company might use permanent cross-functional teams, where each team is responsible for a specific product feature and includes developers, designers, and quality assurance specialists.

### 2.5. Virtual Network Approach

This is an organizational structure in which the organization subcontracts most of its major functions to separate companies and coordinates their activities from a small headquarters organization[cite: 10].

**Characteristics:**
* The "company core (hub)" serves as a central coordinator, connecting with external entities for functions like design (e.g., a design company in Canada), accounts receivable (e.g., a company in Australia), manufacturing (e.g., a company in Asia), transportation (e.g., a company in Korea), and distribution (e.g., a company in Europe)[cite: 10].
* The central hub might also coordinate with a designer, manufacturer, human resources agency, and marketer[cite: 10].

**Advantages:**
* Enhanced global competitiveness by leveraging specialized external partners worldwide[cite: 10].
* Increased workforce flexibility and adaptability to changing demands[cite: 10].
* Reduced administrative overhead due to outsourcing many functions[cite: 10].

**Disadvantages:**
* Lack of hands-on control over outsourced functions[cite: 10].
* Risk of losing an organizational part if a key external partner fails or performs poorly[cite: 10].
* Employee loyalty can be weakened as many employees may not be directly employed by the core organization[cite: 10].

*Example:* A small e-commerce startup might outsource its manufacturing to a factory in Asia, its logistics to a third-party shipping company, and its customer service to an external call center, with only a small core team managing strategy and marketing.

## 3. Emerging Issues in Organizational Design: Project Management

Project management is an important aspect of modern organizational design, especially in organizations that frequently undertake complex, time-bound initiatives.

**Characteristics:**
* Project managers often work across traditional departmental lines to coordinate resources and tasks needed for a specific project[cite: 11].
* They need to collaborate with functional departments such as Finance, Engineering, Purchasing, and Marketing to obtain necessary resources and expertise. For instance, a Project Manager for "Sails and Masts" in a yacht division would interact with a Finance Budget Analyst, a Product Designer, a Buyer, and a Market Researcher from their respective departments, indicated by horizontal dotted lines in an organizational chart[cite: 11].
* The project manager has direct responsibility for the project's success, even if they don't have direct line authority over all team members. This often involves significant negotiation and influencing skills.

*Example:* In a construction company, a project manager for building a new skyscraper will pull resources and expertise from the engineering, finance, procurement, and operations departments, coordinating their efforts to complete the project on time and within budget.
