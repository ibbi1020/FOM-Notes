*Controlling*

**I. Organizational Control**

* Organizational control is a systematic process where managers regulate organizational activities to align with expectations set in plans, targets, and performance standards[cite: 126].
* The core of control involves action that adjusts operations to predetermined standards, relying on information available to managers[cite: 127].

**II. Feedback Control Model**

* The feedback control model assists managers in achieving strategic goals by monitoring and regulating organizational activities and using feedback to assess whether performance meets established standards[cite: 128].
* This type of control focuses on the organization’s output and is also known as post-action or output control[cite: 129].
* **Four Steps of Feedback Control (Exhibit 19.1):**
    1.  Establish strategic goals.
    2.  Establish standards of performance.
    3.  Measure actual performance.
    4.  Compare performance to standards.
        * If inadequate, take corrective action.
        * If adequate, do nothing or provide reinforcement.
    * The process involves feedback loops to adjust standards or performance as needed[cite: 129].

**III. Balanced Scorecard**

* The balanced scorecard is a comprehensive management control system that balances traditional financial measures with operational measures related to a company’s critical success factors[cite: 130].
* **Elements of the Balanced Scorecard (Exhibit 19.2):**
    * Financial performance: Does action contribute to improving financial performance? [cite: 131]
    * Customer service: How well do we serve our customers? [cite: 131]
    * Internal business processes: Do internal activities and processes add value for customers and shareholders? [cite: 131]
    * Potential for learning and growth: Are we learning, changing, and improving? [cite: 131]
* The balanced scorecard includes targets, measures, outcomes, and corrections for each of these elements[cite: 131].

**IV. Controlling Mechanisms**

* Budgetary control is a commonly used managerial control method[cite: 132].
* It involves setting targets for expenditures, monitoring results, comparing them to the budget, and making necessary changes[cite: 133].
* Financial statements provide essential information for an organization's financial control[cite: 134].

**V. Changing Philosophy of Control**

* **Hierarchical Control:**
    * Uses rules, policies, hierarchy of authority, reward systems, and other formal devices to influence employee behavior and assess performance[cite: 135].
    * Assumptions: People are incapable of self-discipline and need close monitoring[cite: 136].
    * Actions: Detailed rules, top-down authority, task-related job descriptions, extrinsic rewards[cite: 136].
    * Consequences: Employees follow instructions, show indifference, high absenteeism and turnover[cite: 136].
* **Decentralized Control:**
    * Uses organizational culture, group norms, and a focus on goals to foster compliance[cite: 136].
    * Assumptions: People work best when committed to the organization[cite: 136].
    * Actions: Limited rules, reliance on values, flexible structure, results-based job descriptions, intrinsic and extrinsic rewards[cite: 136].
    * Consequences: Employees take initiative, are engaged, and have low turnover[cite: 136].
* Exhibit 19.6 summarizes the differences between hierarchical and decentralized control methods.

**VI. Effective Control System**

* An effective control system links strategy, uses understandable measures, has accurate and timely data, and is flexible and reasonable to be accepted by employees[cite: 137].
