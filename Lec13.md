# Maintaining an Effective Workforce

## 1. Training and Development

**Training and development programs** represent a planned effort by an organization to facilitate employees’ learning of job-related skills and behaviors[cite: 54]. These initiatives are crucial for enhancing employee capabilities, improving performance, and fostering continuous growth within the organization.

Key methods and approaches to training and development include:

* **On-the-Job Training (OJT):** A type of training in which an experienced employee ‘adopts’ a new employee to teach him or her how to perform job duties[cite: 55]. This is a hands-on approach where learning happens through direct experience and observation within the work environment.
    * *Example:* A new barista at Starbucks learning to prepare coffee drinks by shadowing an experienced barista and practicing under their guidance.
* **Social Learning:** Learning informally from others by using social media tools[cite: 56]. This leverages digital platforms for knowledge sharing, collaboration, and peer-to-peer learning.
    * *Example:* Employees using an internal company forum or a dedicated Slack channel to ask questions, share best practices, and learn from colleagues' experiences.
* **Mentoring:** When an experienced employee guides and supports a less experienced employee[cite: 57]. Mentoring relationships typically focus on broader career development, offering advice, insights, and networking opportunities.
    * *Example:* A senior manager formally or informally taking a junior employee under their wing to help them navigate career challenges and build leadership skills.
* **Coaching:** A method of directing, instructing, and training a person with the goal to develop specific management skills[cite: 58]. Coaching is often more focused on specific performance improvements or skill gaps.
    * *Example:* An executive coach working with a department head to improve their public speaking or conflict resolution skills.
* **Corporate University:** An in-house training and education facility that offers broad-based learning opportunities for employees[cite: 59]. These are dedicated internal institutions designed to develop employee skills aligned with the company's strategic goals.
    * *Example:* McDonald's Hamburger University, which provides comprehensive training programs for its restaurant managers and franchisees globally, covering operations, leadership, and business management.

## 2. Performance Appraisal

**Performance appraisal** is the process of observing and evaluating an employee’s performance, recording the assessment, and providing feedback to the employee[cite: 60]. This systematic process helps organizations assess employee contributions, identify areas for improvement, and inform decisions related to compensation, promotion, and development.

### 2.1. Assessing Performance Accurately

To ensure accuracy and fairness, organizations employ various methods for performance appraisal:

* **360-Degree Feedback:** A process that uses multiple raters, including self-rating, to appraise employee performance and guide development[cite: 61]. This involves feedback from supervisors, peers, subordinates, and even external customers, providing a holistic view of an employee's performance and behavior.
    * *Example:* A software engineer receiving feedback not only from their direct manager but also from fellow team members, product managers they collaborate with, and even interns they supervise.
* **Performance Review Ranking System:** A process that calculates and compares individual employee performance using metrics like their capabilities and outputs to aid decision-making for accountability, rewards, and dismissals[cite: 62]. This system often involves forced ranking, where employees are categorized into performance tiers.
    * *Example:* General Electric, under Jack Welch, famously used a "rank and yank" system, where a certain percentage of the lowest-performing employees were dismissed annually, while top performers were highly rewarded. While controversial, it aimed to foster a high-performance culture.

## 3. Compensation and Benefits

**Compensation** refers to monetary payments (wages, salaries) and non-monetary goods and commodities (benefits, vacations) used to reward employees[cite: 63]. Effective compensation strategies are critical for attracting, motivating, and retaining a skilled workforce.

### 3.1. Types of Compensation

* **Monetary Payments:**
    * **Wages and Salaries:** Regular direct payments to employees for their work.
    * **Pay for Performance (or Incentive Pay):** Rewards employees based on their productivity, goal attainment, or other performance metrics[cite: 64]. This directly links employee output to their earnings.
        * *Examples:*
            * **Bonus:** An additional sum of money given as a reward for good performance.
            * **Profit-sharing:** A system where employees receive a portion of the company's profits.
            * **Merit-based pay:** Salary increases tied to individual performance evaluations.
            * **Team incentives:** Rewards given to teams for achieving collective goals.
    * *Example:* A sales team receiving a commission (pay for performance) based on the volume of sales they close beyond a certain target.

* **Non-Monetary Goods and Commodities (Benefits):** These are indirect forms of compensation that enhance an employee's overall well-being and job satisfaction.
    * *Examples:*
        * Holiday pay [cite: 64]
        * Medical allowance [cite: 64]
        * On-site daycare [cite: 64]
        * Gym centers [cite: 64]
        * Retirement plans, dental and vision insurance, paid time off, and employee assistance programs.
    * *Example:* Many tech companies, such as Google, offer extensive benefits like free meals, on-site fitness centers, and generous parental leave to attract and retain top talent, contributing to a positive work environment beyond just salary.
