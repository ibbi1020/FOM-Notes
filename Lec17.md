*Managing Teams*

**I. What is a Team?**

* A team is a unit of two or more people who interact and coordinate their work to accomplish a specific goal. [cite: 1]

**II. Group vs. Team (Exhibit 18.1)**

* The lecture emphasizes the distinction between a group and a team, highlighting key differences: [cite: 2]
    * **Leadership:**
        * Group: Has a designated strong leader.
        * Team: Shares or rotates leadership roles.
    * **Accountability:**
        * Group: Holds individuals accountable.
        * Team: Holds team members accountable to each other.
    * **Purpose:**
        * Group: Sets identical purpose for group and organization.
        * Team: Sets specific team vision or purpose.
    * **Work Products:**
        * Group: Has individual work products.
        * Team: Has collective work products.
    * **Meetings:**
        * Group: Runs efficient meetings.
        * Team: Runs meetings that encourage open-ended discussion and problem-solving.
    * **Effectiveness Measurement:**
        * Group: Measures effectiveness indirectly by influence on business (e.g., financial performance).
        * Team: Measures effectiveness directly by assessing collective work.
    * **Work Distribution:**
        * Group: Discusses, decides, and delegates work to individuals.
        * Team: Discusses, decides, and shares work.

**III. How Teams Make a Difference (Exhibit 18.2)**

* Teams contribute to organizational success in several ways: [cite: 3]
    * Creativity
    * Quality
    * Speed
    * Productivity/Lower Costs
    * Employee Satisfaction
* These contributions lead to competitive advantage and higher organizational performance.

**IV. Types of Teams**

* The lecture outlines various team types: [cite: 4]
    * Functional Team
    * Cross-functional Team (Task Force)
    * Special-Purpose Team
    * Self-Managed Teams
    * Virtual Team
    * Global Team
* Exhibit 18.3 visually represents functional and cross-functional teams within an organization.

**V. Personal Dilemma of Teamwork (Exhibit 18.4)**

* The lecture addresses common dysfunctions in teams and their effective counterparts: [cite: 5]
    * **Dysfunction: Lack of Trust**
        * People don't feel safe to reveal mistakes, share concerns, or express ideas.
        * **Effective Team Characteristic: Trust**
            * Members trust one another at a deep emotional level; feel comfortable being vulnerable.
    * **Dysfunction: Fear of Conflict**
        * People go along with others for the sake of harmony; don't express conflicting opinions.
        * **Effective Team Characteristic: Healthy Conflict**
            * Members feel comfortable disagreeing and challenging one another to find the best solution.
    * **Dysfunction: Lack of Commitment**
        * If people are afraid to express their true opinions, it's difficult to gain genuine commitment to decisions.
        * **Effective Team Characteristic: Commitment**
            * Because all ideas are put on the table, people achieve genuine buy-in around important goals and decisions.
    * **Dysfunction: Avoidance of Accountability**
        * People don't accept responsibility for outcomes; engage in finger-pointing when things go wrong.
        * **Effective Team Characteristic: Accountability**
            * Members hold one another accountable rather than relying on managers.
    * **Dysfunction: Inattention to Results**
        * Members put personal ambition or the needs of their individual departments ahead of collective results.
        * **Effective Team Characteristic: Results Orientation**
            * Individual members set aside personal agendas; focus on what's best for the team. Collective results define success.

**VI. Stages of Team Development (Exhibit 18.7)**

* Teams typically progress through five stages of development: [cite: 6, 7, 10, 13, 17, 21]
    * **Forming:**
        * Characterized by orientation and getting acquainted. [cite: 7]
        * Team members get to know each other. [cite: 8]
        * Interactions are often polite and tentative. [cite: 9]
        * Team purpose, goals, and roles may be unclear. [cite: 9]
    * **Storming:**
        * Individual personalities and roles emerge, leading to conflict. [cite: 10]
        * Increased tension and competition for leadership may occur. [cite: 11]
        * This stage is critical for working through issues. [cite: 12]
    * **Norming:**
        * Conflicts from the storming stage are resolved, and team harmony emerges. [cite: 13]
        * The team establishes its rhythm. [cite: 14]
        * Norms and expectations are defined. [cite: 14]
        * Members accept each other, and unity develops. [cite: 15]
        * Roles become clearer, and effectiveness increases. [cite: 16]
    * **Performing:**
        * Members focus on problem-solving and task accomplishment. [cite: 17]
        * The team is highly functional, and members work smoothly together. [cite: 18]
        * Roles are well-understood, and collaboration is strong. [cite: 19]
        * Trust and communication are effective. [cite: 20]
    * **Adjourning (or Mourning):**
        * Members prepare for the team's disbandment. [cite: 21]
        * This stage acknowledges team termination after goal achievement. [cite: 23]
        * Members may experience a sense of loss. [cite: 24]
        * Reflection and celebration of achievements are important. [cite: 24]

**VII. Building Cohesive Teams (Exhibit 18.8)**

* Team norms develop through several ways: [cite: 16]
    * Primacy: First-behavior precedents
    * Carryover from other experiences
    * Explicit statements from leader or members
    * Critical events in the team's history
