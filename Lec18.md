*Managing Team Conflict*

**I. Types of Conflict**

* **Task Conflict:** Conflict arising from disagreements about goals or task content[cite: 1].
* **Relationship Conflict:** Conflict stemming from interpersonal incompatibility, causing tension and animosity[cite: 2].

**II. Balancing Conflict and Cooperation**

* The lecture includes a graph (Image 1 in the presentation) illustrating the relationship between the amount of conflict and team performance.
    * Too little or too much conflict can lead to low team performance.
    * A moderate amount of conflict is generally associated with higher team performance[cite: 2].

**III. Causes of Conflict**

* **Competition over Resources:** Conflict can occur over resources such as money, information, and supplies[cite: 3].
* **Pursuance of Differing Goals:** Conflicting goals, such as those between sales targets or between departments, can be a source of conflict[cite: 4].
* **Communication Breakdowns:** Poor communication, especially in global contexts, and lack of trust due to exclusion from communication, can lead to conflict[cite: 5].

**IV. Styles of Handling Conflict**

* The lecture outlines five styles of handling conflict:
    * **Dominating Style (My Way):**
        * Reflects assertiveness to get one's way[cite: 6].
        * Useful in emergencies or urgent cost-cutting situations[cite: 6].
    * **Avoiding Style (No Way):**
        * Reflects neither assertiveness nor cooperativeness[cite: 7].
        * Appropriate for trivial issues, when a delay for information is needed, or when disruption is costly[cite: 8].
    * **Compromising Style (Halfway):**
        * Reflects a moderate amount of assertiveness and cooperativeness[cite: 9].
        * Suitable when parties have equal power or under time pressure[cite: 10].
    * **Accommodating Style (Your Way):**
        * Reflects a high degree of cooperativeness[cite: 11].
        * Works best when one is wrong, the issue is more important to others, for maintaining harmony, or for gaining social credits[cite: 11].
    * **Collaborating Style (Our Way):**
        * Reflects a high degree of both assertiveness and cooperativeness[cite: 12].
        * Aims for a win-win solution but may require significant negotiation[cite: 13].

* Exhibit 18.10 in the lecture presents a model of these styles based on assertiveness and cooperativeness.

**V. Ways of Expressing Conflict**

* The lecture describes different ways of expressing conflict:
    * **High Directness-High Intensity:**
        * Unambiguous expression using aggressive verbal and non-verbal communication[cite: 14].
        * Examples: Shouting, scowling, eye-rolling[cite: 15].
    * **High Directness-Low Intensity:**
        * Unambiguous communication using a low-voltage style[cite: 15].
        * Examples: Asking questions, listening, debating, deliberating[cite: 16].
    * **Low Directness-High Intensity:**
        * Ambiguous expression using aggressive tactics[cite: 16].
        * Examples: Ignoring viewpoints, mean-spirited teasing, back-stabbing[cite: 17].
    * **Low Directness-Low Intensity:**
        * Ambiguous, low-key expression[cite: 17].
        * Examples: Withholding information, deliberately missing deadlines[cite: 18].

**VI. Negotiation**

* Negotiation involves give-and-take discussions to reach a mutually acceptable decision[cite: 18].

**VII. Rules for Reaching a Win-Win Solution**

* The lecture suggests rules for achieving win-win outcomes:
    * Separate the people from the problem.
    * Focus on underlying interests, not demands.
    * Listen and ask questions.
    * Insist on objective standards for results[cite: 19].
