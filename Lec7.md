## 🗂️ Levels of Strategy

Strategic decisions are made at **three key levels**:

| **Level**               | **Focus**                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Corporate Strategy**  | What business are we in? Broad decisions about markets and industries    |
| **Business Strategy**   | How do we compete in this business? Positioning within a specific market |
| **Functional Strategy** | How do we support the business-level strategy? Departmental execution    |

### Visual Breakdown:

* **Top:** Corporate (e.g., Amazon deciding to enter cloud computing)
* **Middle:** Business (e.g., AWS focusing on secure, scalable infrastructure)
* **Bottom:** Functional (e.g., AWS marketing crafting enterprise-targeted campaigns)

> 🏢 *Example: Google (Alphabet Inc.) operates with a corporate strategy of tech diversification (e.g., Waymo, DeepMind), business-level strategies for products like YouTube, and functional strategies in R\&D and marketing.*
