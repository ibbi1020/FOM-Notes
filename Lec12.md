# Managing Human Resources

## 1. Introduction to Human Resource Management (HRM)

**Human Resource Management (HRM)** encompasses all activities undertaken to attract, develop, and maintain an effective workforce within an organization[cite: 42]. HRM plays a strategically important role as it directly impacts an organization's ability to achieve its goals by effectively managing its most valuable asset: its people.

### 1.1. Core HR Functions and Goals

The three primary goals of HRM are to:
1.  **Find the right people** [cite: 43]
    * This involves activities such as Human Resource Planning, Job Analysis, Forecasting, Recruiting, and Selecting.
2.  **Manage talent** [cite: 43]
    * This includes Training, Development, and Appraisal of employees.
3.  **Maintain an effective workforce** [cite: 43]
    * This covers aspects like Wages and Salary administration, Benefits, Labour relations, and Terminations.

All these functions are interconnected and aligned with the overall **Company Strategy**[cite: 43].

## 2. Attracting an Effective Workforce

Attracting the right talent is the first critical step in HRM. This involves a systematic process of planning, recruiting, and selecting.

### 2.1. Human Resource Planning

**Human Resource Planning** is the forecast of human resource needs and the projected matching of individuals with expected job vacancies[cite: 44]. It's about anticipating future workforce needs, considering factors like retirements, organizational growth, and resignations[cite: 48].

### 2.2. Assessing Jobs: Job Analysis, Description, and Specification

Before recruiting, organizations must clearly define the jobs they need to fill:

* **Job Analysis:** This is the systematic process of gathering and interpreting information about the essential duties, tasks, and responsibilities of a job[cite: 46]. It involves understanding what the job entails.
    * *Example:* For a "Social Media Manager" role, job analysis would involve observing current social media activities, interviewing existing managers, and analyzing platform data to understand daily tasks, required tools, and reporting structures.
* **Job Description:** A **Job Description** is a concise summary of the specific tasks and responsibilities of a particular job[cite: 47]. It outlines what the employee will do.
    * *Example:* A job description for a "Software Engineer" might list responsibilities like "designing, developing, and maintaining software applications" and "collaborating with cross-functional teams."
* **Job Specification:** A **Job Specification** is an outline of the knowledge, skills, education, and physical abilities needed to adequately perform a job[cite: 48]. It defines the qualifications a candidate must possess.
    * *Example:* A job specification for a "Software Engineer" might include "Bachelor's degree in Computer Science," "proficiency in Python and Java," and "experience with agile development methodologies."

### 2.3. Recruiting

**Recruiting** refers to activities or practices that define the desired characteristics of applicants for a specific job[cite: 45]. It's the process of finding and attracting suitable candidates.

The recruiting process often involves:
* **Choosing recruiting sources:** This includes options like advertisements (want ads), headhunters (recruitment agencies), and the Internet[cite: 48].
* **Matching Model:** This model emphasizes matching the company's needs with employee contributions, and company inducements with employee's needs[cite: 48].
    * **Company's Needs:** Strategic goals, current and future competencies, market changes, employee turnover, and corporate culture[cite: 48].
    * **Employee Contributions:** Ability, education and experience, creativity, commitment, and expertise and knowledge[cite: 48].
    * **Company Inducements:** Pay and benefits, meaningful work, advancement opportunities, training, and challenge[cite: 48].
    * **Employee's Needs:** Stage of career, personal values, promotion aspirations, outside interests, and family concerns[cite: 48].

*Example:* Google's recruitment strategy focuses heavily on attracting top engineering talent globally, using online platforms, university recruitment, and employee referrals, while emphasizing its innovative culture and comprehensive benefits (company inducements) to match the needs of highly skilled individuals (employee contributions).

### 2.4. Selection

**Selection** is the process of determining the skills, abilities, and other attributes a person needs to perform a particular job[cite: 49]. This phase typically involves various assessment methods.

#### 2.4.1. Types of Interviews

Interviews are a common selection tool, and they can take different forms:

* **Structured Interview:** Uses a set of standardized questions that are asked of every applicant so comparisons can be made easily[cite: 50]. This ensures fairness and allows for consistent evaluation.
    * *Example:* A call center might use a structured interview with specific questions about handling difficult customers or following scripts.
* **Non-directive Interview:** The interviewer asks broad, open-ended questions and permits the applicants to talk freely with minimal interruption, in an attempt to bring to light information, attitudes, and behavioral characteristics[cite: 51]. This allows for deeper insights into personality and communication style.
    * *Example:* A creative agency might use non-directive interviews to assess a candidate's innovative thinking and how they approach problems.
* **Panel Interview:** Where the candidate meets with several interviewers who take turns asking questions[cite: 52]. This provides multiple perspectives on the candidate.
    * *Example:* For a senior management position, a candidate might be interviewed by a panel consisting of the CEO, Head of HR, and relevant department heads.

#### 2.4.2. Employment Tests

**Employment tests** assess candidates on various factors considered important for the job to be performed and include cognitive ability tests, physical ability tests, and personality tests[cite: 53].

* **Cognitive Ability Tests:** Measure general intelligence, verbal, and numerical abilities.
* **Physical Ability Tests:** Assess strength, endurance, and dexterity, often used for physically demanding jobs.
* **Personality Tests:** Evaluate traits like conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience.

*Example:* Many tech companies use coding challenges as a form of employment test to assess a candidate's practical programming skills.

#### 2.4.3. Appropriate vs. Inappropriate Interview Questions

It's crucial for interviewers to understand what can and cannot be asked during an interview to avoid discrimination and ensure legal compliance. Below is a summary of permissible and impermissible questions:

| Category                 | OK to ask [cite: 49]                                                                   | Inappropriate or Illegal to ask [cite: 49]                                                                      |

#### 2.4.4. Problem-Solving Interview Questions

Some interview questions are designed to assess a candidate's problem-solving skills, creativity, and logical thinking rather than direct knowledge. Examples of such questions and potential good answers include:

1.  **How would you weigh an aeroplane without using scales?**
    * **Good Answer:** Fly it onto an aircraft carrier or other ship big enough to hold it. Paint a mark on the hull of the ship showing the water level. Then remove the plane. The ship will rise in the water. Now load the ship with items of known weight (200 kg bales of wool, for instance) until it sinks to exactly the line you painted on the hull. The total weight of the items will equal the weight of the jet. [cite: 53]
2.  **Why are manhole covers round?**
    * **Good Answer:** A square cover might fall into its hole. In contrast, a round cover with a slight recess in the center can never fall in, no matter how it is held. [cite: 53]
3.  **How much should you charge to wash all the windows in Sydney?**
    * **Good Answer:** Assuming 10,000 city blocks, 600 windows per block, five minutes per window, and a rate of $20 per hour, about $10 million. [cite: 53]
    * *Note:* These questions assess a candidate's ability to think systematically, make reasonable assumptions, and articulate a logical approach to an unfamiliar problem. The exact numerical answer is often less important than the thought process.
