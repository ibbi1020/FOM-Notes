# **Fundamentals of Management – Academic Notes (Lecture 4)**

## **Managing Ethics and Social Responsibility**  

### **What is Managerial Ethics?**  
Ethics refers to the **moral principles and values** that guide human behavior in distinguishing right from wrong.  

### **Three Categories of Human Behavior:**  
1. **Domain of Codified Law (Legal Standards)**  
   - These behaviors are regulated by laws.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - Obtaining a driving license.  
     - Submitting taxes.  
     - Following national and local laws.  

2. **Domain of Ethics (Social Standards)**  
   - Situations where no formal laws exist, but ethical standards should be upheld.  
   - **Example:**  
     - Uber creating **5,000 fake ride cancellations** to sabotage rival Lyft.  

3. **Domain of Free Choice (Personal Standards)**  
   - Personal decisions that do not involve legal or ethical obligations.  
   - **Example:**  
     - Choosing what to eat, wear, or watch.

## **Framework for Ethical Decision-Making**  
There are **five ethical approaches** that managers can use when making decisions:  

1. **Utilitarian Approach**  
   - The ethical choice is one that **produces the greatest good for the greatest number**.  
   - **Example:**  
     - A hospital prioritizing limited resources for patients with the highest survival chances.  

2. **Individualism Approach**  
   - Actions are ethical if they serve the **long-term self-interest of individuals**.  
   - **Risk:** Can be misused for personal gain at the expense of others.  
   - **Example:**  
     - A business investing in employee training because skilled employees contribute to long-term success.  

3. **Moral Rights Approach**  
   - Ethical decisions should **respect fundamental human rights** (e.g., right to privacy, free speech).  
   - **Example:**  
     - A tech company ensuring user data privacy rather than selling it to advertisers.  

4. **Justice Approach**  
   - Decisions should be based on **fairness, equity, and impartiality**.  
   - **Example:**  
     - Gender pay equality—ensuring men and women receive equal pay for the same job.  

5. **Practical Approach**  
   - Bypasses theoretical debates by aligning decisions with **societal norms and stakeholder interests**.  
   - **Example:**  
     - A company deciding on ethical advertising practices by considering public expectations.

## **Stages of Moral Development**  
Ethical decision-making is influenced by **personal factors** such as:  
- **Personality traits**  
- **Family background**  
- **Religious beliefs**  
- **Behavioral traits**  

Moral development progresses through different **stages**, shaping how individuals and managers make ethical choices.

## **Sustainability and the Triple Bottom Line**  

### **What is Sustainability?**

### **Triple Bottom Line (3 Ps of Business Success)**

1. **People (Social Performance)**  
   - Ensuring ethical treatment of employees and communities.  
   - **Example:** A company providing fair wages and safe working conditions.  

2. **Planet (Environmental Performance)**  
   - Reducing ecological impact.  
   - **Example:** A business using renewable energy to minimize its carbon footprint.  

3. **Profit (Financial Performance)**
