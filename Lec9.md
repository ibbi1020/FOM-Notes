# Formulating Business-Level Strategy

## 1. Introduction to Business-Level Strategy

Business-level strategy focuses on how a company will compete in a particular industry or market[cite: 1]. It's about creating and sustaining a competitive advantage. To formulate an effective business-level strategy, it's crucial to understand the competitive landscape and the various tools available for analysis and strategic choice.

## 2. Porter's Five Forces

Porter's Five Forces model is a powerful tool for analyzing the attractiveness and profitability of an industry[cite: 1]. It helps to understand the competitive intensity and identifies areas where a company can gain a competitive advantage. The five forces are:

* **Threat of New Entrants:** This force considers how easy or difficult it is for new competitors to enter the market[cite: 1]. If new entrants can easily come into the market, it can erode the profitability of existing firms. Factors like high capital requirements, strong brand loyalty, and strict government regulations can create barriers to entry.
    * *Example:* The telecommunications industry often has high barriers to entry due to the immense capital investment required for infrastructure.
* **Bargaining Power of Buyers:** This refers to the ability of customers to drive down prices or demand higher quality or more services[cite: 1]. Buyers have more power when there are many suppliers, products are undifferentiated, or buyers purchase in large volumes.
    * *Example:* Large retailers like Walmart have significant bargaining power over their suppliers due to the massive volume of products they purchase.
* **Bargaining Power of Suppliers:** This assesses the ability of suppliers to raise prices or reduce the quality of goods and services[cite: 1]. Suppliers have more power when there are few substitute inputs, their products are critical to the buyer's business, or it's costly for buyers to switch suppliers.
    * *Example:* If a car manufacturer relies on a single supplier for a crucial engine component, that supplier likely has high bargaining power.
* **Threat of Substitute Products:** This force considers the availability of alternative products or services from *other industries* that can satisfy the same customer need[cite: 1]. Substitutes limit the prices companies can charge and can make an industry less attractive.
    * *Example:* For a soft drink company, water, juice, or even coffee can be considered substitute products.
* **Rivalry Among Industry Competitors:** This central force describes the intensity of competition among existing firms in the industry[cite: 1]. High rivalry can lead to price wars, advertising battles, and increased customer service, all of which can reduce profitability. Factors influencing rivalry include the number of competitors, industry growth rate, and product differentiation.
    * *Example:* The smartphone industry is characterized by intense rivalry among major players like Apple, Samsung, and Google, who constantly innovate and compete on features, design, and price.

## 3. Porter's Competitive Strategies

Michael Porter also proposed four generic competitive strategies that organizations can adopt to achieve a competitive advantage[cite: 1]. These strategies are based on two dimensions: source of advantage (low cost or distinctiveness) and strategic target (broad or narrow)[cite: 1].

### 3.1. Cost Leadership

**Definition:** Cost leadership is a competitive strategy where an organization aggressively seeks efficient facilities, cuts costs, and employs tight cost controls to be more efficient than competitors[cite: 3]. The goal is to offer products or services at the lowest possible cost in the industry. [cite: 1]

**Organizational Characteristics:**
* Strong central authority and tight cost controls[cite: 1].
* Maintains standard operating procedures[cite: 1].
* Utilizes easy-to-use manufacturing technologies[cite: 1].
* Highly efficient procurement and distribution systems[cite: 1].
* Close supervision and finite employee empowerment[cite: 1].

**Example:** IKEA is a prime example of a company employing a cost leadership strategy. They achieve low costs through flat-pack furniture (reducing shipping costs), self-assembly by customers, and efficient warehouse operations.

### 3.2. Differentiation

**Definition:** Differentiation is a competitive strategy where an organization seeks to distinguish its products or services from those of its competitors[cite: 2]. The aim is to create something unique and valuable that customers are willing to pay a premium for. [cite: 1]

**Organizational Characteristics:**
* Acts in a flexible, loosely knit way with strong coordination among departments[cite: 1].
* Strong capability in basic research[cite: 1].
* Creative flair; "thinks outside the box"[cite: 1].
* Strong marketing abilities[cite: 1].
* Rewards employee innovation[cite: 1].
* Corporate reputation for quality or technological leadership[cite: 1].

**Example:** Harley-Davidson employs a differentiation strategy by focusing on the unique design, sound, and brand experience of their motorcycles, appealing to a specific customer base willing to pay a premium for their distinctive products. Lush Fresh Handmade Cosmetics also differentiates itself through handmade products, natural ingredients, and a strong ethical stance.

### 3.3. Focused Differentiation

**Definition:** Focused differentiation uses characteristics of the differentiation strategy but directs them at a particular target customer[cite: 1]. This strategy aims to serve a specific niche market with unique products or services.

**Organizational Characteristics:**
* Uses characteristics of differentiation strategy directed at a particular target customer[cite: 1].
* Values flexibility and customer intimacy[cite: 1].
* Pushes empowerment to employees with customer contact[cite: 1].

**Example:** A company specializing in custom-made, high-end bicycles for professional athletes would be an example of focused differentiation. They differentiate their product but for a very specific, narrow target market.

### 3.4. Focused Cost Leadership

**Definition:** Focused cost leadership uses characteristics of the cost leadership strategy but directs them at a particular target customer[cite: 1]. The objective is to serve a specific niche market with the lowest possible cost.

**Organizational Characteristics:**
* Uses characteristics of cost leadership strategy directed at a particular target customer[cite: 1].
* Frequent detailed control reports[cite: 1].
* Measures cost of providing product or service and maintaining customer loyalty[cite: 1].

**Example:** A regional airline that offers no-frills flights between specific, less-traveled routes at significantly lower prices than major airlines would be pursuing a focused cost leadership strategy.

## 4. New Trends in Strategy

The business landscape is constantly evolving, leading to new strategic approaches.

### 4.1. Innovation from Within (Dynamic Capabilities)

This trend emphasizes leveraging and developing more from a firm's existing assets, capabilities, and core competencies to achieve a sustained competitive edge[cite: 5]. It's about an organization's ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments.

### 4.2. Strategic Partnerships

Strategic partnerships involve collaboration between organizations to achieve mutually beneficial goals[cite: 5]. These can range from low collaboration to high collaboration.

**A Continuum of Cooperative Strategies:**
* **Preferred Supplier Arrangements (Low Collaboration):** A company designates a particular supplier as their preferred choice, often due to a long-standing relationship or specific expertise.
* **Strategic Business Partnering:** A more formal and deeper collaboration where two companies work together on specific projects or initiatives.
* **Joint Ventures:** A separate legal entity created by two or more companies to undertake a specific economic activity. This involves shared ownership, risks, and rewards.
    * *Example:* Sony Ericsson was a joint venture between the Japanese conglomerate Sony and the Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson to manufacture mobile phones.
* **Mergers (High Collaboration):** Two companies combine to form a new single entity[cite: 5]. This usually happens between companies of similar size.
    * *Example:* The merger between Kraft and Heinz (Kraft Heinz Company) created one of the largest food and beverage companies in the world. Similarly, the Mobilink Warid merger in Pakistan created a larger telecommunications entity.
* **Acquisitions (High Collaboration):** One company purchases another company and establishes itself as the new owner[cite: 5]. The acquired company often ceases to exist as an independent entity.
    * *Example:* Vodafone's acquisition of Mannesmann was a significant event in the telecommunications industry, and Dawlance being acquired by Ar√ßelik shows a similar strategic move in the home appliance sector.

## 5. Global Strategies

As businesses increasingly operate across borders, different global strategies emerge based on the need for global integration and national responsiveness[cite: 6].

* **Export Strategy:** This strategy is domestically focused, where a company exports a few domestically produced products to selected countries[cite: 6]. It has low global integration and low national responsiveness.
    * *Example:* A small artisanal cheese producer in France might export their products to a few specialty stores in the US.
* **Globalization Strategy:** This strategy treats the world as a single global market and standardizes global product and advertising strategies[cite: 6]. It has high global integration and low national responsiveness. The focus is on efficiency and economies of scale.
    * *Example:* Coca-Cola often uses standardized advertising campaigns and product formulations across many countries.
* **Multidomestic Strategy:** This strategy handles markets independently for each country, adapting product and advertising to local tastes and needs[cite: 6]. It has low global integration and high national responsiveness. This strategy is suitable when there are significant differences in consumer preferences across countries.
    * *Example:* Food companies often adapt their product offerings to local tastes and dietary restrictions in different countries. McDonald's, for instance, offers different menu items in various countries to cater to local preferences.
* **Transnational Strategy:** This strategy seeks to balance global efficiencies and local responsiveness, combining standardization and customization for product and advertising strategies[cite: 6]. It has high global integration and high national responsiveness. This is a complex strategy to implement but can offer significant advantages.
    * *Example:* Companies like Procter & Gamble might centralize research and development for new products (global integration) but allow local marketing teams to adapt advertising and product variations to suit specific cultural contexts (national responsiveness).
